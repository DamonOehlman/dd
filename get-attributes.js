  ### get-attributes

  `(regex, => el) => {}`

  This is a simple but useful attribute extractor that can be used to pull
  attributes that match a particular pattern from an element. The primary
  use case is around custom attributes (such as those used in
  [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/)) but could also be used to extract
  your own `dataset` attribute collection from an element.
