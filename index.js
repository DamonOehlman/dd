/**
  # dd

  A set of DOM utilities, which were first created in
  [cog](https://github.com/DamonOehlman/cog) but have been extracted as cog
  is more a JS language toolset, and `dd` is it's DOM counterpart.

  As per `cog` it is designed to be used as in a cherry-picking way rather
  than by simply requiring `dd` as a whole module.
